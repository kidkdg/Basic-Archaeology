    <p>History (derived from Ancient Greek ἱστορία (historía) 'inquiry; knowledge acquired by investigation')[1] is the
    systematic study and documentation of human past.[2][3] History is an academic discipline which uses a narrative to
    describe, examine, question, and analyze past events, and investigate their patterns of cause and effect.[4][5]
    Historians debate which narrative best explains an event, as well as the significance of different causes and effects.
    Historians debate the nature of history as an end in itself, and its usefulness in giving perspective on the problems of
    the present.[4][6][7][8]</p>
