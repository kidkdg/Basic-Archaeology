    <h2>prehistory</h2>

    <p>Prehistory, also called pre-literary history,[1] is the period of human history between the first known use of stone
    tools by hominins c. 3.3 million years ago and the beginning of recorded history with the invention of writing systems.
    The use of symbols, marks, and images appears very early among humans, but the earliest known writing systems appeared
    c. 5,200 years ago. It took thousands of years for writing systems to be widely adopted, with writing having spread to
    almost all cultures by the 19th century. The end of prehistory therefore came at different times in different places,
    and the term is less often used in discussing societies where prehistory ended relatively recently.</p>
