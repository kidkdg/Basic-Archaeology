    <h2>Archaeology</h2>

    <p>Archaeology or archeology[a] is the study of human activity through the recovery and analysis of material culture. The
    archaeological record consists of artifacts, architecture, biofacts or ecofacts, sites, and cultural landscapes.
    Archaeology can be considered both a social science and a branch of the humanities.[1][2][3] It is usually considered an
    independent academic discipline, but may also be classified as part of anthropology (in North America â€“ the four-field
    approach), history or geography.[4]</p>
